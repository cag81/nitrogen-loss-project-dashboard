# nitrogen-loss-project-dashboard
## Overview
This interactive Dash web application visualizes nitrogen loss across the Chesapeake Bay agricultural supply chain for the years 2017, 2030, and 2050. The dashboard provides insights into where and how nitrogen is lost, trade behavior, and crop and animal production trends under future scenarios.

The model is based on research outlined in this paper, supporting USDA’s 2030 nitrogen reduction goals by identifying key nitrogen loss hotspots and potential mitigation strategies.

## Features
📊 Nitrogen Loss Visualization – Interactive choropleth maps showing nitrogen loss across supply chain stages.
🔄 Yearly Comparison (2017, 2030, 2050) – Select different years and compare nitrogen loss trends.
🌍 Trade Behavior Analysis – Identify nitrogen movement across counties (import/export/within-county flows).
🌾 Agricultural Production Trends – Pie charts & tables summarizing harvested area and inventory by commodity.
📉 Data Processing & Modeling – Machine learning (K-means clustering), ETL pipelines, and statistical analysis applied for insights.

## Tech Stack
Python: Data processing, modeling, and visualization.
Dash & Plotly: Web-based interactive visualizations.
Pandas & NumPy: Data wrangling and statistical computations.
Dash Bootstrap Components (DBC): UI enhancements.
GeoJSON & Plotly Choropleth Maps: Spatial analysis & visualization.

Data Sources
The data used in this dashboard includes:

Nitrogen Loss Data: Aggregated from crop production, feed waste, livestock processing, food waste, and human nitrogen waste.
USDA & EPA Climate Data: Used to model future nitrogen loss scenarios.
NREL Renewable Energy Data: Integrated for further energy-climate interactions (if applicable).

## Future Improvements
🚀 Potential enhancements include:

Performance optimization with Dash caching & lazy loading.
More granular trade analysis using network graphs.
Integration with live USDA/EPA APIs for real-time data updates.
